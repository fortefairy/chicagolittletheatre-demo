### About the Chicago Little Theater Demo

The Chicago Little Theater Demo site is a CollectionBuilder site meant to teach you about how CollectionBuilder works. It is not the full Chicago Little Theater site, which can be found here.

#### So What's the Difference?

Unlike the full site, this demo site is run on CollectionBuilder-GH, a more user-friendly version of CollectionBuilder. However, with that usability, we lose certain functionalities like the ability to create thumbnail images. This site is meant to show you how CB works and get you started with creating your own CB site.

#### What is the Little Theatre Movement?

{% include feature/image.html objectid="coll014" width="50"%}

The Little Theatre Movement was an American theater movement that started in the early 20th century. As the film industry began to grow, there was concern that live theater would become obsolete. The movement was a means of fighting against that by providing more accessible avenues to produce live theater productions. These were often small, experimental productions that didn't require the large production budgets of commercial theaters of the time. Commercial theater, in that era, was mostly centered around melodrama, which were big emotionally-charged productions with often lavish sets. Even as the medium began to trend more towards realism, prices remained high. Little Theaters across the country, mostly centered in big cities such as Chicago in New York, sought to remedy this with community-based theater.
##### Theater vs. Theatre?

There isn't a difference! *Theatre* is the British spelling and *theater* is the American spelling. The *Little Theatre Movement* was popularized before most Americans used the American spelling, which is why when we talk about the name of the movement, we use *theatre* and everywhere else we use *theater*.

#### What Does This Site Offer?

This site offers a wide array of content that is likely in the public domain! That includes programs, playbills, and photos of productions in Chicago during the Little Theatre Movement as well as full-texts of plays that were performed when available. Eventually, we'd like to also have a timeline of each season (but we won't get ahead of ourselves)
